looking at me like it's lunchtime\nI know there was a time where once I\nWas king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\nSo I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\nAppeal with the skin color of mine\nYou get too big and here they come trying to,\nCensor you like that one line I said on \"I'm Back\" from the Marshall Mathers LP\nOne where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine\nPut 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine\nSee if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've\nMorphed into an immortal coming through the portal\nYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though\nAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for\nYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows\nYou're like normal, fuck being normal\nAnd I just bought a new Raygun from the future\nTo just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad\nSingin' to a man while they played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day\n\"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you\"\nLyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, JJ Fad\nUh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber\nSo that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you\nI'm never stating, more than never demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating\nCause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\nOh, he's too mainstream\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\nIt's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it\nI don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use\nLet me know when it occurs to yousat\nWhile I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to,\nProve that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!\nSchool flunkie, pill junky\nBut look at the accolades the skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues\nBut it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you\nI'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat\nBumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils, here's what they want from me\nThey asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had\nThen you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then\nBut if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\nDon't mistake it for Satan\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\nAnd take a vacation to trip a broad\nAnd make her fall on her face and don't be a retard\nBe a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?\nStarting right now I'll be strong\nI'll play my fight song\nAnd I don't really care if nobody else believes\n'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me\nLosing friends and I'm chasing sleep\nEverybody's worried about me\nIn too deep\nSay I'm in too deep (in too deep)\nAnd it's been two years I miss my home\nBut there's a fire burning in my bones\nStill believe\nYeah, I still believe\nAnd all\u2026\n\n", "execution_count": 8, "outputs": [{"output_type": "stream", "text": "Overwriting lyrics1.txt\n", "name": "stdout"}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "with open('lyrics1.txt', 'r') as f:\n    print(f.read())\n", "execution_count": 9, "outputs": [{"output_type": "stream", "text": "most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger\nI been grinding outside, all day with my niggas\nAnd I ain't going in, unless I'm with my nigga\nMy nigga, my nigga\nMy nigga, my nigga\nMy nigga, my nigga\nMy nigga, my nigga\n\nFirst things first, I love all of my niggas\nThis rap shit crack, then I involve my niggas\nYou looking for some lean, let me call my niggas\nHe sell it for the high, I need all my niggas\nSome niggas smoke, smoke some niggas drink, drink\nGot niggas on the block with the glock they dont think\nThat's a nigga back up, they in the bucket lapped up\nI got thst act right if you niggas wanna act up\nHe talking like a snitch, no that ain't my nigga\nHe trippin off a bitch, no, that ain't my nigga\nTake a nigga case, shit, that's my nigga\nKnow him since I was 8, yeah, that's my nigga\nFucked my first bitch passed her to my nigga\nHit my first lick pass with my nigga\nFuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas\nI ride for my niggas, fuck them other niggas\nmost likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger\nI been grinding outside, all day with my niggas\nAnd I ain't going in, unless I'm with my nigga\nMy nigga, my nigga\nMy nigga, my nigga\nMy nigga, my nigga\nMy nigga, my nigga\n\nYou know I'm down with the niggas down for me\nI got two words for you, love and loyalty\nIt's me and my nigga tripping on a half of bean\nWe used to hit up wall and buy everything you see\nMe and my down ass nigga getting twisted\nNigga get to tripping he knock the gravy, out your biscuit\nJay know I fuck with you the long way, my nigga\nSo when I see you out I'm like hey, my nigga\nTried to act right, buy the case with my niggas\nDrink the act right and get straight with my niggas\nMe and my nigga riding dirty, tryna chase them figures\nWho got the yola? who got the yola?

I take seven kids from Columbine\nPut 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine\nSee if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've\nMorphed into an immortal coming through the portal\nYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though\nAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for\nYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows\nYou're like normal, fuck being normal\nAnd I just bought a new Raygun from the future\nTo just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad\nSingin' to a man while they played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day\n\"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you\"\nLyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, JJ Fad\nUh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber\nSo that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you\nI'm never stating, more than never demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating\nCause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\nOh, he's too mainstream\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\nIt's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it\nI don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use\nLet me know when it occurs to yousat\nWhile I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to,\nProve that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!\nSchool flunkie, pill junky\nBut look at the accolades the skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues\nBut it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you\nI'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat\nBumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils, here's what they want from me\nThey asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had\nThen you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then\nBut if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\nDon't mistake it for Satan\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\nAnd take a vacation to trip a broad\nAnd make her fall on her face and don't be a retard\nBe a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?\nStarting right now I'll be strong\nI'll play my fight song\nAnd I don't really care if nobody else believes\n'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me\nLosing friends and I'm chasing sleep\nEverybody's worried about me\nIn too deep\nSay I'm in too deep (in too deep)\nAnd it's been two years I miss my home\nBut there's a fire burning in my bones\nStill believe\nYeah, I still believe\nAnd all\u2026\n\n\n", "name": "stdout"}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "ls -l", "execution_count": 10, "outputs": [{"output_type": "stream", "text": "total 16\r\n-rw-r----- 1 dsxuser dsxuser 15316 Oct 15 08:26 lyrics1.txt\r\n", "name": "stdout"}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "import random, re\n\n# freqDict is a dict of dict containing frequencies\ndef addToDict(fileName, freqDict):\n\tf = open(fileName, 'r')\n\twords = re.sub(\"\\n\", \" \\n\", f.read()).lower().split(' ')\n\n\t# count frequencies curr -> succ\n\tfor curr, succ in zip(words[1:], words[:-1]):\n\t\t# check if curr is already in the dict of dicts\n\t\tif curr not in freqDict:\n\t\t\tfreqDict[curr] = {succ: 1}\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\t# check if the dict associated with curr already has succ\n\t\t\tif succ not in freqDict[curr]:\n\t\t\t\tfreqDict[curr][succ] = 1;\n\t\t\telse:\n\t\t\t\tfreqDict[curr][succ] += 1;\n\n\t# compute percentages\n\tprobDict = {}\n\tfor curr, currDict in freqDict.items():\n\t\tprobDict[curr] = {}\n\t\tcurrTotal = sum(currDict.values())\n\t\tfor succ in currDict:\n\t\t\tprobDict[curr][succ] = currDict[succ] / currTotal\n\treturn probDict\n\ndef markov_next(curr, probDict):\n\tif curr not in probDict:\n\t\treturn random.choice(list(probDict.keys()))\n\telse:\n\t\tsuccProbs = probDict[curr]\n\t\trandProb = random.random()\n\t\tcurrProb = 0.0\n\t\tfor succ in succProbs:\n\t\t\tcurrProb += succProbs[succ]\n\t\t\tif randProb <= currProb:\n\t\t\t\treturn succ\n\t\treturn random.choice(list(probDict.keys()))\n\ndef makeRap(curr, probDict, T = 50):\n\trap = [curr]\n\tfor t in range(T):\n\t\trap.append(markov_next(rap[-1], probDict))\n\treturn \" \".join(rap)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n\trapFreqDict = {}\n\trapProbDict = addToDict('lyrics1.txt', rapFreqDict)\n\tstartWord = input(\"What do you want to start your rap with?\\n > \")\n\tprint(\"Alright, here's your rap:\")\n\tprint(makeRap(startWord, rapProbDict))\n\n", "execution_count": 11, "outputs": [{"output_type": "stream", "name": "stdout", "text": "What do you want to start your rap with?\n > bad\nAlright, here's your rap:\nbad disastrously actually \nit's pupil homage, pay and thor be i'll now right act the on moved \nthey me make lemons, you if mistake fatal a like you anything do shot, one get only \nyou \n better \nyou hop hip not do gotta i \nthat practicing i'm and \ninnovative superhuman i'm\n"}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
